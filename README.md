# Chat Application
This is a basic real-time chat application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows users to send and receive messages instantly in a shared chat room. The app features a clean and responsive user interface, message display area, input box, and real-time message updates.

**Key Features:**
🗨️ Real-time Messaging: Users can send and receive messages without reloading the page.
💬 Chat Window: Messages appear in a scrollable chat area with timestamps.
🎨 Responsive UI: Styled with CSS for a modern and user-friendly experience.
⚡ JavaScript-Powered: Handles message sending, receiving.

**Technologies Used:**
HTML – For the structure and layout of the chat interface.
CSS – For styling the chat box, messages, and layout responsiveness.
JavaScript – For DOM manipulation, message handling, and updating the UI in real time.

**How It Works:**
The user opens the chat page.
They enter a message into the input field and hit send.
JavaScript captures the input, displays it in the chat window, and (optionally) sends it to a server or local storage.
